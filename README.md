# Duolingo-Deutsch-English-vocab-list
Need a list of words that are a bit harder to remember as you're learning a new language?  Use a google form to create a google sheets list of vocab words.

You'll need the following for each word:
  1. German Word
  2. English Word
  3. Category for the Word

When you click "submit" on the Google form and entry is added to a Google sheet with your vocab word and it's translationa and category.

Once a list of vocab words has been created, you can have Google sheets group your words in various different ways.  I like to group by category and German word.
